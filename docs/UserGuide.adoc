+
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

== What's New in Version 1.2

=== Optimized Autocomplete

Autocomplete should be running slightly faster, with slightly less strain on the processor.

=== FindTag

Finds all persons whose tags contain any of the specified tags (not case-sensitive) and displays them as a list with index numbers. +
Format: `findtag TAG [MORE_TAGS]...`

Example: `findtag friends family` +
Searches for all persons containing `friends` tag or `family` tag.

=== Enhanced RemoveTag command

Now, you can specify which person you want to remove the tag from and not just remove from everyone on the list.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
